<Meta title="Design System/Getting Started" />

# Getting Started

Install the design system and dependencies in your application

```bash
yarn add @committed/components @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
```

## ThemeProvider

Wrap the root of your application with the `ThemeProvider` component,
which adds the Design System theme to the context for use in components.
This should only be included once in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@committed/components'
import AppRoot from './AppRoot'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AppRoot />
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

## Primitive UI Components

Import and use the design system UI components in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Box, Typography } from '@committed/components'

const AppRoot = (props) => (
  <Box p={3}>
    <Typography>Hello</Typography>
  </Box>
)
```

## Icons

We do not re-export the Material Icons, we recommend using the Sharp icons from `@material-ui/icons`.
In order to use these you must add the dependency:

```bash
yarn add @material-ui/icons
```
