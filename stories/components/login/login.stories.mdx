# Login

A login form following [best practices](web.dev/sign-in-form-best-practices/#checklist).

It uses built in brower validation of emails and passwords with `type="email"` and `type="password"`.

The signin button is disabled while sign in is taking place to prevent accidental multiple login attempts.

The form is mobile friendly. `type=email` is used to bring up the correct keyboard.

The typed in password can viewed with the show password button to make sign in easier.

Accessiblity is considered. `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` is used for password inputs.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default">
    <Login
      onChangeEmail={() => {}}
      onChangePassword={() => {}}
      email="jsmith"
      password="password"
      onSignIn={() => {}}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The `passwordRules` optionally displays the password rules for easier sign in.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="password rules">
    <Login
      onChangeEmail={() => {}}
      onChangePassword={() => {}}
      email="jsmith"
      password="password"
      onSignIn={() => {}}
      passwordRules="8 or more characters with one letter and symbol"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The `errorMessage` can be used to display errors related to sign in.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="error">
    <Login
      onChangeEmail={() => {}}
      onChangePassword={() => {}}
      email="jsmith"
      password="password"
      onSignIn={() => {}}
      errorMessage="Account is disabled or does not exist"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
