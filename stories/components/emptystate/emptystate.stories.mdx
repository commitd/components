# EmptyState

See [Empty states](https://material.io/design/communication/empty-states.html#content).

Empty states can display a wide variety of content. For example, they can include a list without list items, or a search that returns no results. Although these states arenâ€™t typical, they should be designed to prevent confusion.

Use the `logo` prop to provide an image as a hint to the type of result or query that has returned without any results. It is an opportunity to add branding to your app.
