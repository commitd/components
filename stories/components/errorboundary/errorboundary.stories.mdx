# ErrorBoundary

Automatically catch React errors in the component tree, optionally displaying an error message.

As of React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree.

It is a good idea to strategically wrap components with error boundaries to handle and report errors to prevent them propagating through the entire React app and forcing a reload of the page.

In the event of an error an `ErrorMessage` component will display an error message. In some cases it may be best to hide the error, in which case `errorComponent={null}` will hide all child components.
