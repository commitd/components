## Install

```bash
yarn add @committed/components
```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

import { Component } from '@committed/components'

class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Component />
  }
}
```

## Development

We are using npm v7, and due to issues with peer dependencies we are currently required to do

```bash
npm install --force
```

The main build is performed using esbuild:

```bash
npm run build
```

We use storybook to develop and document the components, this is run in development using

```bash
npm run storybook
```

The tests can be run with

```bash
npm test
```

## Dev Containers

This project contains a [VSCode Dev Container Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

To use this, you must install the [VSCode Remote Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

Once this is installed, you should be prompted (when opening the project in it's root directory) to `Reopen in Container`. If this prompt does not appear, open the Command Palette and run `Remote Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

This will re-open the project, with the project files mounted in a Docker container, which will include all the VSCode extensions from the dev container (e.g. useful extensions, formatters etc).

## CI

Pull requests go through CI checks using Github Actions. Releases update the deployed documentation and update the package in the NPM registry.
