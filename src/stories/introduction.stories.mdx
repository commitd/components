# Committed Components

<code>v{version}</code>

This is Committed's design system.

It serves as a resource to help define a common visual language for Committed applications.
This is a living system, and will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our design system.

## Getting Started

Here are a few helpful links for getting started with Committed Components:

- [Getting Started](/?path=/docs/design-system-getting-started--page) Install and setup Components for your React app.
- [Design Principles](/?path=/docs/design-system-design-principles--page) Learn about the principles for the design.
- [Overview](/?path=/docs/design-system-overview) Get an overview of the main components in the system.
- [Status](/?path=/docs/design-system-status--page) See the status of different components.

## Motivation

Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible.
This is the heart and primary value of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by
clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Regardless of the technologies and tools chosen, we aim to follow these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s reusable**. The components are built so they can be reused in many contexts, but not all.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with Components are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform, it should perform with minimal bugs.
