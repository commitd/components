<Meta title="Design System|Getting started" />

# Getting Started

Ensure you have setup access to the github @commitd packages, by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-package-registry).
Install the design system and dependencies in your application

```sh
yarn add @commitd/components @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
```

## ThemeProvider

Wrap the root of your application with the `ThemeProvider` component,
which adds the Design System theme to the context for use in components.
This should only be included once in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@commitd/components'
import AppRoot from './AppRoot'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AppRoot />
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

## Primitive UI Components

Import and use the design system UI components in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Box, Text } from '@commitd/components'

const AppRoot = props => (
  <Box p={3}>
    <Text color="blue">Hello</Text>
  </Box>
)
```

## Icons

We currently use the Sharp icons from `@material-ui/icons` exposed on the `Icons` component. In order to use this you must add the peer dependency:

```sh
yarn add @material-ui/icons
```
