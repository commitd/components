<Meta title="Design System|Getting started" />

# Getting Started

Install the design system in your application

```sh
yarn add @committed/components
```

## ThemeProvider

Wrap the root of your application with the `ThemeProvider` component,
which adds the Design System theme to the context for use in components.
This should only be included once in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@committed/components'
import SomeView from './SomeView'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <Heading.h1>Hello</Heading.h1>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

## Montserrat font

To use the Montserrat font-family in you project, be sure to include a link in your document `<head>`.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:400,600"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## Primitive UI Components

Import and use the design system UI components in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Box, Text } from '@committed/components'

const SomeView = props => (
  <Box p={3}>
    <Text color="blue">Hello</Text>
  </Box>
)
```
