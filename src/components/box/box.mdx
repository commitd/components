# Box

Use the `Box` component to control width, margin, padding, and color.

50% width

<Playground>
  <Box width={1 / 2} bg="blue">
    Box
  </Box>
</Playground>

Padding of `theme.space[3]` (16px)

<Playground>
  <Box p={3} bg="blue">
    Box
  </Box>
</Playground>

Margin of `theme.space[2]` (8px)

<Playground>
  <Box m={4} bg="blue">
    Box
  </Box>
</Playground>

Color primary from the theme's color palette

<Playground>
  <Box color="primary">Box</Box>
</Playground>

## Responsive Widths

The `width` prop accepts an array value to set different widths at different breakpoints with a mobile-first approach.

<Playground>
  <Box
    width={[
      1, // Sets width 100% at the smallest breakpoint
      1 / 2, // Sets width 50% at the next breakpoint
      1 / 4 // Sets width 25% at the next breakpoint
    ]}
    bg="blue"
  >
    Hello
  </Box>
</Playground>

See [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) for more documentation.

## Props

The spacing of a `Box` is defined by padding an margin options below. These options are also available on all components, so they can be positioned as required but they are
not repeated on all components props tables.

Remaining props for box configuration.

<Props of={Box} />
