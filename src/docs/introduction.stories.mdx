# Committed Components

<!-- Omitted due to Storybook v6.3 bug https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/15359
<code>v{version}</code> -->

<code>v6.x.x</code>

This is Committed's design system.

It serves as a resource to help define a common visual language for Committed applications.
This is a living system, and will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our design system.

It's intended for Committed use but feel free to use it or the `src` in your own projects.
